The focus of this bachelor thesis is the topic of multiple right hand sides equations and their solving. The main aim of the work was to design and implement a program that can be used for the manipulation with the system of these equations. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter defines multiple right hand sides equations and their systems. Subsequently, this chapter also describes operations, which can be performed on the equations or the systems without changing the solution. The second chapter is focused on the MRHS solver, a program that solves the systems of multiple right hand sides equations, and at the heuristic algorithm that is used to optimize the system. The third chapter analyzes the requirements under which our program is implemented. The fourth chapter contains a description of implementation and a list of commands, which the program supports as far as modifications of the system are concerned. The fifth chapter is dedicated to the formulation of the methodology, that was followed during the performance and evaluation of the experiments. This chapter also characterizes the testing platform. The sixth chapter analyzes the performed experiments along with graphs and the evaluation of measured results. In the last chapter, the experimental algorithm for system expansion is shown, based on assumptions from experiments.
